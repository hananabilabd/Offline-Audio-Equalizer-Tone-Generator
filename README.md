Offline Audio Equalizer &amp; Tone Generator

This is a Nice Project for Equalization of any .Wav File
You can use the tone generator to generate a .Wav  with the desired frequencies 
First we browse the .Wav we saved from the tone generator or any other .wav file from the computer
You can manipulate the gain of different frequencies components in the .Wav file  
There are 4 Graphs 
2 Graphs for the audio signal in time domain before and after manipulation
2 Graphs for the audio signal in the frequency domain before and manipulation
There are 10 sliders Each sliders can control and manipulate 1K Hz (1st Slider control from 1K to 2k Hz second one from 2K to 3K Hz , etc... )
You can then save  the  .Wav after manipulation
You can also Browse for .txt file and do all the previous steps
